### Honest feedback (important for growth)

Your project idea is **strong for a portfolio** because:

- Real **full-stack Django app** ✅  
- Community-focused concept (good startup seed) ✅  
- Clear feature roadmap (shows vision) ✅  

**To make this portfolio-level impressive**, next big upgrades should be:

1. **Live deployed demo link** (very important)
2. **Screenshots GIF or video preview**
3. **API documentation**
4. **Tests**
5. **Docker deployment**

When you add these, this repo becomes **serious internship-level proof**.
